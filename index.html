        HTML is short for HyperTextMarkupLanguage. Basically, it's the "code"
        behind every webpage-even this one. If you're just begining to learn
        HTMl. let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without
        styling, can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table,
        or creating frames-but it is handy as it helps you structure the content
        correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your
        HTML.
      </p>

        However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
        to full-fledged web devlopment. Various tools easily eliminate HTML
        coding from your work process - but if you want to be in full control of
        your web - page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this article, we aim to give the essential HTML buliding blocks
        that'll help you get up and running. Reading this, you'll be able to
        understand an HTML source code andeven modify it for your own good!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Step One - Tags
      </h2>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
      <p>
        Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML sorce code.
        A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document.
        Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at two types of tags:
        <ol type="1">
          <li> &lt tag - example - 1 &gt I need a closing tag &lt tag - example - 1 &gt</li>
          <li>&lt tag-example-2/&gt I don't need a cloding tag </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p> 
        In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag
        and the second one is called closing tag. Everyhting in between is affected by the properties of the tag.
        Very commonly used examples of such tags are &lthtml&gt,&lthead&gt,&ltbody&gt,&ltstrong&gt,etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second example tags about loner tags - as in, they don't need a closing ytag to functon. Although
        it's not required, these type of tags are often wriiiten ans &lttag/&gt to make the debugging of the code easier.
        Common examples of such tags are &lthr/&gt - used for horizontal line, &ltbr/&gt - to break the line,etc. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Step Two -- HTML,HEAD,and BODY : The three pillars of your document</h2>
      <img src = "https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg">
      <p>
        These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code.
        <ul type="disc">
        <li> &ltb&gt &lt/b&gt makes your text look <b>bold</b></li>
        <li> &lti&gt &lt/i&gt makes you write in <i>cursive</i></li>
        <li> &ltu&gt &lt/u&gt <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p> For example, this piece of code</p>
      <hr>
      <code>
        &lthtml&gt <br><br>
        &nbsp&lthead&gt &lt/head&gt<br><br>
        &nbsp&ltbody&gt <br><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &lti&gt I am italics! &lt/i&gt &ltbr/&gt <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &ltb&gt I am bold! &lt/b&gt &ltbr/&gt <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &ltu&gt And me, well, I'm underlined!  &lt/u&gt &ltbr/&gt <br><br>
        &nbsp&ltbody&gt <br><br>
        &lt/html&gt
      </code>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Should produce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much about &ltbr/&gt. It's just for breaking the line
         so that you can start from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing lines in your HTML document.
      </p>
      <img src = "https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001490.png">
      <p>
      <h4>Tags to help you structure your content:</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li> &ltbr&gt breaks the line, making you continue to the next line</li>
        <li> &ltp&gt stands for paragraph. It divides your content into paragraphs</li>
      </ul>
      <i>
        Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an
        HTML document.
      </i>
      </p>
      <h4> Heading Tags: </h4>
      
      <p>
        HTML provides you with six tags, from &ltH1&gt&lt/H1&gt to &ltH6&gt  to help you create different sized headers quickly.
      </p>
      <img src = "https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png">
      <p>
        <h4>Inserting an Image:</h4>
        <br>
        All that's good but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry, &ltIMG/&gt to the rescue!
        The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look
        for the image. The syntax goes something like:
        <br><br>
        <i>
           &ltimg src = "path_to_your_image"/&gt
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthuermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you
        want your image to take.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4> Lists:</h4>
      <p>
        HTML has two type of lists - ordered and unordered. Eachitem of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The
        syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you want to create a list like:
        <br>
        <ul type = "disc">
          <li> Item 1</li>
          <li> Item 2</li>
          <li> Item 3</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code will easily do the job for you:
      </p>
      <hr>
      <code>
          &ltul type = "disc"&gt<br>
             &nbsp&nbsp &ltli&gt Item 1 &lt/li&gt<br>
             &nbsp&nbsp &ltli&gt Item 2 &lt/li&gt<br>
             &nbsp&nbsp &ltli&gt Item 3 &lt/li&gt<br>
              &lt/ul&gt
      </code>
      <hr>
      <br><br><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list, allyou need to do is 
      replace &ltul&gt with &ltol&gt and &lt/ul&gtwith&lt/ol&gt.
      <br><br>
      Let's see what the following code does:
      <hr>
    </p>
    <code>
      &lthtml&gt <br><br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt &lt/head&gt <br><br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt <br><br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltul&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am unordered list's intem 1! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am unordered list's intem 2! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am unordered list's intem 3! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am unordered list's intem 4! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/ul&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltol&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am ordered list's intem 1! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am ordered list's intem 2! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am ordered list's intem 3! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt I am ordered list's intem 4! &lt/li&gt<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/ol&gt<br><br>
      &nbsp &lt/body&gt<br><br>
      &lt/html&gt

      We request you to go ahead and try skimmingthrough the source code of any website (
        "you'll find some tags you don't know, but that's how you learn!"
      ). Oh, and welcome to the word of web development. With HTML under your belt, your next stop 
      should be making your page look beautiful using CSS.
